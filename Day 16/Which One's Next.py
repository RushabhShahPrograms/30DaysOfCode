'''
Given a list of integers nums, return the number of elements x there are such that x + 1 exists as well.
Explanation:

For e.g.:

nums = [3, 1, 2, 2, 7], 
We can take
1. 1 since 1 + 1 exists in the list.
2. 2 since 2 + 1 exists in the list.
3. Another 2.
So total output is 3.

Input Format
length = 5,
nums = [3, 1, 2, 2, 7]

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Output Format
3

Sample Input 0
5
3 1 2 2 7

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0

We can take

1 since 1 + 1 exists in the list.
2 since 2 + 1 exists in the list.
Another 2.
So total output is 3.
