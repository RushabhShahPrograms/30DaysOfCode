'''
You are given a list of integers tasks where each different integer represents a different task type, and a non-negative integer k. Each task takes one unit of time to complete and each task must be done in order, but you must have k units of time between doing two tasks of the same type. At any time, you can be doing a task or waiting.

Return the amount of time it takes to complete all the tasks.

Input Format

length = 4
k = 2
nums = [0 1 0 1]
Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of tasks

0 1 0 1
Sample Output 0

Explanation 0

The tasks get run the following way: [0, 1, wait, 0, 1]. Note that before running the second 0 task we must wait one unit to have 2 units of time before running it again. We can just run the second 1 task right away since it has already been 2 units of time since we last did task 1.

Explanation 1

The tasks get run the following way: [0, wait, 0, 1, wait, 1].
