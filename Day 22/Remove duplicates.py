'''
Given a list of integers nums, remove numbers that appear multiple times in the list, while maintaining order of the appearance in the original list.

It should use O(k) space where k is the number of unique integers.

Input Format

length = 7

nums = [1, 3, 5, 0, 3, 5, 8]

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Output Format

1 0 8

Sample Input 0

7
1 3 5 0 3 5 8
Sample Output 0

1 0 8
Explanation 0

Only [1, 0, 8] are unique in the list and that's the order they appear in.

Sample Input 1

8
0 1 3 1 3 4 6 5
Sample Output 1

0 4 6 5
